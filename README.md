# Observable trends
* max temperature drop significantly when we are heading to the (north pole our south pole) compared to the equator.
* couldn't find big different for wind speed at the time of data being taken, however it rases little bit towards the north and south pole
* the southern hemisphere trends more hotter temperature degrees than the northern hemisphere at time of data being collected, which make sense as the southern hemisphere is in Summer season while winter season in the Northern hemisphere
