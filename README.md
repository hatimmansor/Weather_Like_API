# What's the Weather Like?
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
In this example, I have created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

# Data Source:
* [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* [Google Maps API](https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json)

# Technologies/Tools: 
&#10004;Pandas      &#10004;Gmaps      &#10004;Matplotlib      &#10004;Python        
&#10004;API calls

# Observable trends
* max temperature drop significantly when we are heading to the (north pole our south pole) compared to the equator.
* couldn't find big different for wind speed at the time of data being taken, however it rases little bit towards the north and south pole
* the southern hemisphere trends more hotter temperature degrees than the northern hemisphere at time of data being collected, which make sense as the southern hemisphere is in Summer season while winter season in the Northern hemisphere
